Lab 1 Worksheet

Answer the following questions in a text file(NOT A WORD DOCUMENT!). Add your answer below each question.



1. Where is the assertEquals method defined? What does it do? Can we use assertEquals for more than just int types? (Hint: Consult the API for JUnit)

assertEquals. Asserts that two object arrays are equal. If they are not, an AssertionError is thrown with the given message. If expecteds and actuals are null , they are considered equal.

2. Briefly describe what each of the three tests is checking.

arr1 checking the class function when array has less then two elements.
arr2 checking the class funtion when all elements in array are same.
arr3 checking the class the main fuction about  find Smallest Different  in the arrays.

3. Why is our unimplemented findSmallestDiff method passing one of the tests?
 Because the given class was return 0 and that match up with test 2 was expectation. Therefore test 2 passed.


4. Why are we failing the third test? How should our method be modified to correct this?

because the result of the third test was not match the expectation. we shoud modified our expectation to pass the third test.

5. What is the appropriate call to assertEquals for your new test (test 4)?

largeRandomArrayElement

6. Provide one more test (test 5) for the findSmallestDiff method. Briefly describe your test and write the call to assertEquals here.

7. Briefly describe your unit tests for Assignment 1.

Use random array to create matrixes to test time ,plus, equals and toString match our expectations.
